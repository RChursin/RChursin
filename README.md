Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Roman Chursin, a passionate SDET and Front-End Developer with nearly a decade of experience delivering top-notch quality in Web and Mobile applications.

I thrive on building robust test automation solutions using Python, JavaScript, and my newly embraced TypeScript. Over the years, Iâ€™ve engineered and transitioned frameworks using Selenium, Playwright, and Cypress, alongside various CI/CD integrations such as LambdaTest, SauceLabs, BrowserStack, Harness, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions.

While quality assurance is my home turf, Iâ€™m equally excited about front-end development. Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into React, NextJS and modern JavaScript/TypeScript practices, expanding my skill set to craft efficient, user-friendly interfaces.

Currently at Kajabi, I lead initiatives around automation and process optimization, bridging the gap between development and QA. I thrive on mentoring, architecting test strategies, and constantly exploring new technologies to improve product reliability and user experience.

Each day is a fresh opportunity to sharpen skills and learn something new, and Iâ€™m just loving every moment of it. If youâ€™re interested in collaborating, feel free to reach outâ€”letâ€™s connect and build something amazing together!
