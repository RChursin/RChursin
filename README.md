# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Roman Chursin

I'm an enthusiastic automation engineer who's honed skills in Selenium coupled with the pytest framework.<br>

Lately, I've embarked on a new adventure, stepping into the world of front-end development, and I'm getting my hands dirty with JavaScript and React.<br>
