# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Roman Chursin

Hey there! Iâ€™m really into automation engineering, especially with my go-to languages: JavaScript and Python.<br>  
These languages have been at the core of my adventures in automation, where Iâ€™ve gotten hands-on with cool frameworks like Selenium and pytest for Python, as well as Cypress and Playwright for JavaScript setups.  
Over at Kajabi, I've been using these tools to make things run smoother and more efficiently.  
And that's not all â€“ I've recently started exploring the world of front-end development, getting a good grip on JavaScript and trying out React.  
Each day is a chance to learn something new, and Iâ€™m just loving the journey and all the opportunities coming my way!
